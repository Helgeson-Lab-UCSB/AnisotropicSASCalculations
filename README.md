# AnisotropicSASCalculations
Includes example functions for calculating SAS from a known OPDF

"cylinderscatteringcalculatorfromopdf.m" and "paralellepipedscatteringcalculatorfromopdf.m" are example functions that calculate anisotropic scattering from a known OPDF.

"AnisotropicScatteringCalculationExample.m" is an example script that relies on the function "FokkerPlanckDiluteRodSolver.m" found in the OPDF simulation directory.
Output of this script with initial parameters is the directory picture
